I've been busy this year, let's talk about that.

[What is Blogvent?](/2022-11-27-blogvent-calendar/) (**tl;dr** I am going to write one post a day for all of December as a way to practice writing.)

## C++ Conferences

So I've been to a few conferences this year. I'd say the conference circuit year for me started a year ago when I did an [online talk at CPPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su9SfiGySFQ) and ended today when I did an online talk for Meeting C++ (same talk subject actually).

After all of these conferences I've been thinking, is this something I want to do? Do I want to continue writing talks and submitting to as many conferences as I can.

And after some thinking the answer is ... it depends.

I do enjoy doing talks, I do enjoy (to a degree) the talk development process. But I think in the last year I pushed it too far. I created a few talks, submitted them everywhere. One talk included a lot of research into the subject matter, and I also did a lightning talk at all the conferences.

Working at that level is too much for me. I was looking at the other pros in the conference scene and trying to emulate a fraction of their power. It's not for me.

So the idea is that I will still submit talks and I will try to do conferences, but only if I feel I really have something to talk about. But I will also not do as many in one year.

## Today's talk

Just a few minutes ago I finished a talk on WebAssembly and C++ at the Meeting C++ online meetup. Was quite a lovely experience and I got many good questions regarding how WebAssembly functions under the hood.

I do like giving back to the audience, so alongside the talk there is a [code repo they can look at](https://github.com/olafurw/talk-accu-webassembly) and as an extra twist for this talk, I wrote a [very simple presentation system in Rust and WebAssembly](https://github.com/olafurw/webassembly-presentation) and revealed that halfway through a WebAssembly talk that the talk itself is also written using WebAssembly.

This enabled fun interactions like showing the game the talk revolves around inside of the presentation itself, which is a lovely bonus.
