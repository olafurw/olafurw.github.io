Time to binge!

[What is Blogvent?](/2022-11-27-blogvent-calendar/) (**tl;dr** I am going to write one post a day for all of December as a way to practice writing.)

Recently I did a [tool recommendation](/2022-12-12-tool-recommendations/), but since the holiday season is near and people have more free time, I think it's time to recommend some videos for you to watch. They're all tech related in some ways and I think it's a nice enough mix that there should be something for everyone.

## C++ Weekly

If you're working with a lot of C++ and you don't have [C++ Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/@cppweekly/videos) on your subscription list then I highly suggest you fix that. If I were to recommend one recent video of his it would be:

[Episode 350 - The Right Way to Write C++ Code in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Gv4J3FyYE)
[![video1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/q7Gv4J3FyYE/0.jpg "Episode 350 - The Right Way to Write C++ Code in 2022")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Gv4J3FyYE)

Here he goes over the tools that you should look into, the usage of static and runtime analysis, testing and more. Go check it out!

## Rust

Want to dip your toes into what Rust has to offer? Then I recommend checking this talk from the Rust Linz Meetup back in 2021 from Tim McNamara.

[Rust Linz, June 2021 - Tim McNamara - How to learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDtQaO5_SOw)
[![video2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/sDtQaO5_SOw/0.jpg "Rust Linz, June 2021 - Tim McNamara - How to learn Rust")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDtQaO5_SOw)

Both a great introduction to the language and the 2nd half should give you the confidence you need to keep going!

## No f*** thanks

Want something tech but not directly programming? Then I highly recommend "Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs" by Folding Ideas. Where Dan looks at the history of NFTs, how they actually work, the people behind them and the effect this whole thing has on people, especially in poorer nations. Go watch.
