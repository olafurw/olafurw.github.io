I'm sorry.

I told you that this was a [writing exercise.](/2022-11-27-blogvent-calendar/) This was not. Well, there is some writing exercise in this but that was not the point.

This was a burnout test.

For the last year, I've been actually afraid of large projects. Even just thinking about them triggered a pretty big fight or flight response.

I had a hunch that this has been getting better, so I decided to create a long running project that had me committed to do certain work, in public, every day for a month.

So Blogvent was made.

I think I did it.

Thanks for reading. See you next year.
