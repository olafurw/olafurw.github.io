I like <span class="replace-flying">flying</span>, I find everything about it fascinating. The large and small <span class="replace-airplanes">airplanes</span>, the varied <span class="replace-flight-paths">flight paths</span> they undertake.

The whole world of <span class="replace-flying">flying</span> is very interesting.

It takes a long time to learn <span class="replace-flying">flying</span>, you not only have to take lessons, but also have many hours of practice under your belt. This practice is often named as the most important thing of learning to <span class="replace-fly">fly</span>, the lessons themselves will only get you so far.

When you have practiced for many hours, you can then think about what kind of <span class="replace-flight-paths">flight paths</span> you want to do. Some people plan out <span class="replace-flight-paths">flight paths</span> when they are still learning, and that is also ok, and often encouraged.

Some people <span class="replace-fly">fly</span> <span class="replace-flight-paths">flight paths</span> that take a short time and some <span class="replace-fly">fly</span> ones that take a long time, and even some that can be done in many discrete steps.

Sometimes the people that <span class="replace-fly">fly</span> are not the ones that plan the <span class="replace-flight-paths">flight paths</span>, and in many circles this is the most common way of doing things.

It is important that when you have planned your <span class="replace-flight-path">flight path</span> and actually started <span class="replace-flying">flying</span> that you don't stop abruptly. This could mean really bad things, but sometimes the <span class="replace-airplanes">airplanes</span> are able to handle it. Oh how good they are.
