Congratulations. Your application to Quarantine Code Con (QCC) has been accepted. The conference takes place from Friday evening of April 10th 2020 until Monday evening of April 13th 2020.

There are two tracks at this conference, each with their own unique and desctiptive name. And we also have two wonderful keynotes that will start and end the conference. I'm sure you will enjoy them.

Where did the talks come from? Every single talk here came recommended in a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/olafurw/status/1248165087216635904) I made a few days ago asking for programming talks that made them go *"Holy shit, this is amazing!"*

## Logistics

How will this work?

Here below is the schedule of the conference, with each track and keynote listed. For each day, you pick a track and watch that talk on your own or you can gather a few friends and watch the talk together using whatever online tech is available to you.

Due to timezones and people's schedules, how this is done is purely up to you. Watch just 1 talk or watch them all, watch them all at once or follow the schedule, no matter, this is your conference.

The videos are linked and not embedded to make sure you go to the channel of the talk, if you then want to watch more from that channel or person, or even subscribe, also if you like each video, please give them a like if possible.

If you have further questions. There is an FAQ below the schedule.

## Schedule

Here is the schedule for Quarantine Code Con.

## Friday Keynote

**Title:** A Possible Future of Software Development  
**Speaker:** [Sean Parent](https://twitter.com/seanparent)  
**Date of Recording:** 2007-07-25  

**Abstract:**

> This talk begins with an overview of software development at Adobe and a look at industry trends towards systems built around object oriented frameworks; why they "work", and why they ultimately fail to deliver quality, scalable, software. We'll look at a possible alternative to this future, combining generic programming with declarative programming to build high quality, scalable systems.

## Saturday

Welcome to the Saturday talks, I hope you enjoyed Sean's talk. Here are three tracks you can pick from!

### Track A

**Title:** Data-Oriented Design and C++  
**Speaker:** [Mike Acton](https://twitter.com/mike_acton)  
**Date of Recording:** 2014-09-11  

**Abstract:**

> The transformation of data is the only purpose of any program. Common approaches in C++ which are antithetical to this goal will be presented in the context of a performance-critical domain (console game development). Additionally, limitations inherent in any C++ compiler and how that affects the practical use of the language when transforming that data will be demonstrated.

### Track B

**Title:** Treat Your Code as a Crime Scene  
**Speaker:** [Adam Tornhill](https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill)  
**Date of Recording:** 2016-05-25  

**Abstract:**

> We’ll never be able to understand large-scale systems from a single snapshot of the code. Instead we need to understand how the code evolved and how the people who work on it are organized. We also need strategies that let us find design issues and uncover hidden

## Sunday

Wow, what a Saturday, I hope you got some good rest and are ready for the Sunday talks!

### Track A

**Title:** Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript  
**Speaker:** [Anjana Vakil](https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil)  
**Date of Recording:** 2016-04-24

**Abstract:**

### Track B

**Title:** Programming with GUTs  
**Speaker:** [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney)  
**Date of Recording:** 2015-11-20

**Abstract:**

> These days testing is considered a sexy topic for programmers. Who'd have thought it? But what makes for good unit tests (GUTs)? There's more to effective unit testing than just knowing the assertion syntax of a framework.  
>  
> Testing represents a form of communication and, as such, it offers multiple levels and forms of feedback, not just basic defect detection. Effective unit testing requires an understanding of what forms of feedback and communication are offered by tests, and what styles encourage or discourage such qualities.  
>  
> What style of test partitioning is most common, and yet scales poorly and is ineffective at properly expressing the behaviour of a class or component? What styles, tricks and tips can be used to make tests more specification-like and can scale as the codebase grows?

## Monday

Last day of the conference, home stretch. Two talks and then the closing keynote talks. Let's get some coffee and get going!

### Track A

**Title:** Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python  
**Speaker:** [Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh)  
**Date of Recording:** 2013-03-15

**Abstract:**

> This fast-paced tutorial is for beginning and intermediate Python programmers who want to write better code. The focus is on improving craftsmanship with a handful of specific code transformations that can be immediately applied to your current projects.
>  
> We start by showing how to replace traditional index manipulation with Python's core looping idioms: iter, range/xrange, zip/izip, enumerate, reversed, sorted, and items/iteritems. More advanced techniques include for/else to replace unnecessary state flags and using the two-argument form of iter() to transform function calls into iterators...

### Track B

**Title:** Performance Matters  
**Speaker:** [Emery Berger](https://twitter.com/emeryberger)  
**Date of Recording:** 2019-09-14

**Abstract:**

> Performance clearly matters to users. For example, the most common software update on the AppStore is "Bug fixes and performance enhancements." Now that Moore's Law has ended, programmers have to work hard to get high performance for their applications...

## Monday Keynote

**Title:** We Really Don't Know How to Compute!  
**Speaker:** [Gerald Sussman](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/gjs.html)  
**Date of Recording:** 2011-10-27  

**Abstract:**

> Though we have been building and programming computing machines for about 60 years and have learned a great deal about composition and abstraction, we have just begun to scratch the surface.
>  
> A mammalian neuron takes about ten milliseconds to respond to a stimulus. A driver can respond to a visual stimulus in a few hundred milliseconds, and decide an action, such as making a turn. So the computational depth of this behavior is only a few tens of steps. We don't know how to make such a machine, and we wouldn't know how to program it...

## FAQ

**Is this a serious conference?**  
No.

**What's the point?**  
Because we're going through these times of social distancing and quarantine and with many software conferences being cancelled, I just wanted to just do something, even as small and simple as this. Just something that resembles structure, some sort of camaraderie, just ... something.

**Do we have to watch things at certain times?**  
No. Watch any of these whenever you want. It just has a conference structure for the fun of it.

**I don't like a certain talk, what do I do?**  
```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```

**Are there badges?**  
No. But you can make one, please show me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/olafurw)

**I like this idea, can I copy it?**  
Of course. Let me know, I might join ya in watching.

**I represent one of these talks and I don't want them here.**  
Send me a DM on [twitter](https://twitter.com/olafurw) and I'll remove them.
